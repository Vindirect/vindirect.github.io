  &amp; Tricks</h2>
<h4>Change Time of Day!</h4>
<p>- Don't like the light settings on a particular map? Launch Worldbuilder, open 
  the map and hit ctrl+D a few times to change time of day. Save.</p>
<h4> Custom Settings!</h4>
<p>- If you want increased performance to speed up the game, switch to low detail 
  or custom settings (I prefer having cloud ground shadows and smooth water).</p>
<h4> Garrison in the building!</h4>
<p>- To make the computer garrison in a specific building, select the building 
  in Worldbuilder and name it "PlayerX GarrisonY" (without the ""). 
  X is the number of the team that you want to garrison in the building and Y 
  is 1, 2, or 3 (You can have at least three different buildings for each team 
  to garrison in).</p>
<h4> Create Waves!</h4>
<p>- To create your own waves try <a href="http://www.cncden.com/genmaps_scripts.shtml" target="_blank">WAKedit</a>! 
  To disable waves simply delete the .wak file in the map folder.</p>
<h4> Check out this map!</h4>
<p>- Wanna improve your maps? Download the map <a href="ftp://ftp.ea.com/pub/eapacific/generals/generals/DownloadablePatches/Flash%20Fire.zip">Flash 
  Fire </a> by the C&amp;C Generals team! Check it out in Worldbuilder.</p>
