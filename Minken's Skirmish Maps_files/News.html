<h2>2009-03-11 Minken's Skirmish Maps R4</h2>
<p>One of my friends told me the other day that some of my old maps are still popular. Apparently, some people think they are still worth playing.<br>
  I do not know who posted them on download.com.
<a href="http://www.download.com/Command-Conquer-Generals-Anthrax-Fortress-map/3000-18541_4-10231111.html" target="_blank">Anthrax Fortress more than 2300 downloads!?</a> Cool! :)<br>
<br>
Well, because of this I did the following stupid things:<br>
<br>
1. Put the old web site online, including downloads!<br>
2. Posted all the skirmish maps updated for Zero Hour! <br>
3. Included four "new" skirmish maps for Zero Hour: <a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/DesertTrap.html">Desert Trap</a>, <a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/FallOfMeteors.html">Fall of Meteors</a>, <a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/NoSurrender.html">No Surrender</a>, and <a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/SwampMatrix.html">Swamp Matrix</a>! :)<br>
<br>
Minken's Skirmish Maps R4 is here! Enjoy! :)</p>

<p>Spent some time building this frame-based web for easier navigation. Hope you 
  like it!<br>
  The <a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/index_noframes.html" target="_blank">no-frames version</a> is not 
  100% up to date.</p>

<p><a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/AnyIsland.html">Any Island</a> is an old 6-player map that I finally 
  finished!</p>
<h2>2003-05-01 Two new 6-player maps!</h2>

<h2>2003-04-28 World Builder Textures</h2>

<h2>2003-04-25 New Maps!</h2>
<p>Release 3 is here! Five brand new maps: two small 4-player maps and three 8-player 
  maps!<br>
  Some modified maps (based on the old 4-player maps from release 2) have been 
  made available as well.<br>
  Thanx <font color="#800000">Minken</font> for beta-testing the maps with me!
