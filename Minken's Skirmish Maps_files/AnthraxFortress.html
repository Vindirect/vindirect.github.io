<h4>About</h4>
<p><font color="#800000">Minken:</font> <font color="#0080C0">"&amp;#%% you 
  can make good-looking maps for this game!"</font><br>
  This is my first map. I had no clue how to apply textures when I started working 
  on this one - and when I finally found that nifty paint brush I couldn't help 
  myself but painting a lot! The result was a few 3-way blended textures which 
  isn't really optimal. I have reworked the textures in release 3.</p>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>The map consists of a number of islands, connected through bridges or roads. 
  Each player start in a corner of the map. There are two entrances to each base. 
  The central part of the map is a volcanic island - a huge crater. It's a terrorist 
  outpost for production of anthrax, now under UN surveilance. There is a scud 
  storm site in the middle of it that players can capture to launch a blasting 
  early surprise after four minutes of playing. There are also other very valuable 
  buildings on the central island; a particle cannon, an oil derrick, an oil refinery, 
  a hospital, GLA barracks and arms dealer, and a black market - "everything 
  the body needs" :)<br>
  However, it will be hard to hold the central parts against several enemies.<br>
  There are a few buildings throughout the map for your rocket soldiers to occupy, 
  and there are some civilian cars for your GLA suiciders too.</p>
<h4>Supplies</h4>
<p> Each base starts out with one supply dock, and three suply piles. Beside the 
  central treasures, each base has the same distance to additional oil derricks, 
  and some UN supplies. There is a supply drop zone on the central island as well, 
  but I don't think it is capturable. It contributes to the overall look of the 
  map, with the C130 aircraft sweeping overhead.</p>
<h4>Strategies</h4>
<p>Since large portions of the map consists of water, a strong airforce is a plus. 
  However, it would take quite some time to build, and there is not a lot of space 
  where you start out for those airfields. Securing the bridges and water crossings 
  with bunkers and artillery works very well. You can even rush to middle to capture 
  the scud site, but I can promise it won't go unnoticed. You would also have 
  to wait before you could launch it if you are too quick. If you manage to hold 
  the central parts, you have a great advantage. Capture the GLA arms dealer and 
  you can produce more vehicles without building further. The mountain sides can 
  be protected from the top of the hills with anti-air forces. It can be difficult 
  to launch an attack on the ground due to the narrow water crossings.</p>
<h4>AI</h4>
<p>The AI works ok with this map but not great. One starting position sometimes 
  have troubles (I think lower left corner) but the other three work as intended. 
  Your base may be attacked from both sides, depending on what path the computer 
  choses. The central island is considered a key position, and the computer will 
  send tanks to guard it early in the game. Both oil derricks and the hospital 
  are known to be captured by the computer. The scud storm and other buildings 
  are not.</p>
