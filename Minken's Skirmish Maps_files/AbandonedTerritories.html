<h4>About</h4>
<p>A medium-detailed 400x400 dirt/desert 6-player map.<br>
  Note: Worldbuilder doesn't work well with bridges :(</p>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p> Some abandoned mines and outposts in a desert. A plateau in the north and 
  a river flowing through the landscape. Mountain ridges and water separating 
  the base areas. The villages are nearly destroyed. The country has been seriously 
  injured by GLA scud storms and nukes. There are dangerous warheads in the field. A couple of 
  chemical bunkers are ready to blow up. The locals have all fled or hung themselves 
  behind the hospital on the hill. The coast in the south has been spared. Only 
  a few farmers have stayed here in the river deltas.</p>
<h4>Supplies</h4>
<p>You start out with one supply dock. There are oil derricks and oil refineries 
  in the deserts and towards the middle. A hospital has barely survived the chaos. 
</p>
<h4>Computer-Controlled Players (AI)</h4>
<p>Works very well :)</p>
