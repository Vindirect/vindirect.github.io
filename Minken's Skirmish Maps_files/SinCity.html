<h4>About</h4>
<p><font color="#800000">Minken:</font> <font color="#0080C0">"This map has 
  potential!"</font><br>
  A very high-detailed 450x450 8-player map - 3000 objects (maximum allowed).<br>
  Some basic scripting of civilian units moving around in the city.<br>
  A police car (Larry's brother at the wheel?) is chasing some car thieves, so 
  watch out!<br>
  If you have the video card to play this map, you'll like it!<br>
  Sin City resides on a large island.</p>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>You will be pretty isolated when you start. Water separates you from your closest 
  enemies. There are a number of bridges to cross the water and make your way 
  into the city. The city has lots of buildings but offer wide streets to advance 
  large forces. There are some chemical bunkers on this map that you can capture 
  or just blow up in the face of your enemy. </p>
<h4>Supplies</h4>
<p> You start out with one supply dock. There are oil derricks and oil refineries 
  on the island as well as a hospital. Add 120.000 worth of supplies inside the 
  city! You will also have a great advantage if you can secure any of the corners 
  with the extra supply docks.</p>
<h4>AI</h4>
<p><font color="#800000">Minken:</font> <font color="#0080C0">"Where the 
  #%&amp;&amp; did they come from!!!?"</font><br>
  No problem! The city will quickly turn into a battle zone, and everything will 
  go up in flames!<br>
  AI will capture everything it can lay hands on and move to the corners as well 
  as inside the city for extra supplies.</p>
