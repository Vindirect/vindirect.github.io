<h4>About</h4>
<p><font color="#800000">Minken:</font> <font color="#0080C0">"Mu-ha-ha-ha!"</font><br>
  My second map. This map looks really good with desert textures (<a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/DesertMaze.html">Desert 
  Maze</a>), but I wanted a dark, soily look. Unfortunately the editor doesn't 
  come with a lot of textures for this setting so I ended up with a landscape 
  of gravel and dirt. The yellow trees bring a feeling of autumn to the scenery. 
  I worked my a$$ off to smoothen the mountain ridges since I made them too steep 
  in the beginning. The problem with steep slopes is that you cannot paint them 
  smothly since they consist of only a few polygons.</p>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>I started playing with the height tool, building mountain ridges and valleys 
  in a symmetrical way. The result was a cross, that needed a few passages. As 
  with any good map, every base should have at least three entrances so I created 
  a central maze towards the middle of the map and roads forming a circle around 
  the map to connect the bases on each side. You can cross the map over the mountain 
  ridges as well. There is a watch tower towards the central part heading out 
  from your base, and some building facing the very middle.</p>
<h4>Supplies</h4>
<p>You start out with one supply dock and three supply piles. Directly behind 
  your starting position - in the very corner of the map - is an oil derrick just 
  waiting to be captured. There are more oil derricks along the side-roads between 
  the base locations. In the central cavity are two supply docks with lots of 
  extra cash waiting. If you gain control of this area you have a big advantage.</p>
<h4>AI</h4>
<p>The AI works very well on this map. You might experience attacks from any of 
  the three entrances at any time. Your base will be quite compact, so any super 
  weapon will certainly find many targets.</p>
