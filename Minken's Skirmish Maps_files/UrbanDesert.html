<h4>About</h4>
<p>I wanted to test some new stuff like road networks in uneven terrain, water 
  polygons, lots of buildings - a stress test sort of. This maps is based on <a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/GravelMaze.html">Gravel</a>/<a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/DesertMaze.html">Desert 
  Maze</a>. It is much more detailed and offer urban warfare. <a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/UrbanSavanna.html">Urban 
  Savanna</a> is the same map but with textures remapped.</p>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>Based on Gravel/Desert Maze with the cross-formation and road formations. A 
  city stretches across the mountains. Lots of civilian buildings and vehicles. 
  Still a fairly symmetrical layout. </p>
<h4>Supplies</h4>
<p>You start out with one supply dock and three supply piles. There are oil derricks 
  along the side-roads between the base locations. A hospital and two oil refineries 
  can be found In the central area. There are more supplies and oil derricks in 
  the mountain villages.</p>
<h4>AI</h4>
<p>I have changed some skirmish AI settings on this map. The original map had 
  centerpaths from the center of the map, causing a few chokes when troops are 
  travelling in both directions in and out from the center. In this map, the centerpaths 
  run across the mountains through the villages. This will cause the computer 
  to send troops near the locations of supplies and oil derricks instead of getting 
  stuck in the middle.</p>
