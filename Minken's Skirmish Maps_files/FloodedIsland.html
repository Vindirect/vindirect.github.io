<h4>About</h4>
<p>Flooded Island is a modified version of the map  <a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/AnyIsland.html">Any Island</a>. As the name implies, the island has been partly flooded. Any Island was difficult due to open landscape making it difficult to prepare for land-based attacks. There are a number of  fixes  to improve several aspects of game-play:</p>
<p> - Base areas are now more isolated by water but connected via bridges.<br>
  - Added two large banana-shaped craters and six smaller rounded craters in the combat zone.<br>
  - Base areas have been flattened to make base building easier.<br>
  - Added gun towers next to supply docks nearby starting positions.<br>
  - Added a 1500$ crate behind each starting position.<br>
  - Positions and angles of various buildings, oil derricks, roads, and gun towers have been corrected.<br>
  - Changed angle of some buildings and reinforcement pads.<br>
  - Two towers and a truck was removed from the middle of the map.<br>
  - AI attack paths have been tweaked.<br>
- Added rocks and fixed some textures.</p>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>A large island with a central platuae. Desert/meadow textures... quite a mix. <br>
Two smaller islands with treasures in the sea!</p>
<h4>Supplies</h4>
<p>One supply dock per base area. Extra supply docks between bases. Oil derricks and oil refineries on the central plateau. Some smaller supply piles around the oil derricks, and a supply dock in the center of the plateau. The small islands in the sea offers some extra goodies.</p>
<h4>AI</h4>
<p>This map is challenging!<br>
  The computer AI tends to expand and attack counter-clockwise, as usual.<br>
Optimized for Advanced AI Mod for C&amp;C Generals: Zero Hour v0.98</p>
