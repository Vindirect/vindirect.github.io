<p>There are lots of known minor map bugs that I am not going to list here.</p>
<p><font size="2">1. Zero Hour needs larger base areas than Generals for additional buildings. Because of this, older (smaller) maps 
  may not work very well with Zero Hour.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">2. All maps may experience lag (slow-motion, freeze) due to any of the following situations:</font></p>
<p>A. The computer tries to capture buildings that are out of reach (rare).</p>
<p><font size="2">B. Zero Hour units with special features (such as climbing mountain walls or jumping off cliffs) may get stuck.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">C</font><font size="2">. Jarmen Kell shoots a vehicle in a choke point or on a bridge. Other units are blind to this vehicle.</font></p>
<p>D.<font size="2"> Red guards (or mini-gunners) in a troop crawler vehicle may </font>suffer total confusion when the vehicle is destroyed...</p>
<p><font size="2">E. Computer-controlled troups gather behind cliffs or mountain ridges (rare).</font></p>
<p>3. The computer never learned to handle his particle cannon. ;)</p>
