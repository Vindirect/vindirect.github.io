<h4>About</h4>
<p>This is the desert-version of <a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/GravelMaze.html">Gravel Maze</a>. Textures 
  have been replaced and light settings changed from evening to morning. Some 
  buildings were changed and a few civilian bunkers added.</p>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>Each base area has three entrances. You can cross the map over the mountain 
  ridges as well. There are civilian bunkers near the bases along the roads and 
  in the mountains facing the central cavity of the map.</p>
<h4>Supplies</h4>
<p>You start out with one supply dock and three supply piles. Directly behind 
  your starting position - in the very corner of the map - is an oil derrick just 
  waiting to be captured. There are more oil derricks along the side-roads between 
  the base locations. In the central area there are two supply docks with lots 
  of extra cash, and an oil refinery.</p>
<h4>AI</h4>
<p>The AI works very well on this map. You might experience attacks from any of 
  the three entrances at any time. Your base will be quite compact, so any super 
  weapon will certainly find many targets. The narrow valleys into the central 
  parts can sometimes be choking points when the computer tries to send troops 
  in both directions.</p>
