<h4>About</h4>
<p>I don't remember how this map started out, but it never felt like a good one. 
  The slopes surrounding the bases feel a bit too steep and un-natural, and it's 
  hard to navigate your troops in the middle. There is plenty of building space 
  though. </p>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>Quite large base areas with three entrances. Some civilian buildings stand 
  between you and your closest enemies. Capture them to hold them off. There are 
  civilian cars as well for suicide bombers. The middle part consists of five 
  crater lakes with small islands on the bottom. There is a skyscraper and some 
  other buildings around the central crater.</p>
<h4>Supplies</h4>
<p>As usual, I've addeed one supply dock and some smaller supply piles nearby 
  each starting position. Some extra supplies have been placed towards the middle. 
  There are two hospitals and two oil refineries along the sides of the map. The 
  middle parts hold deep craters where oil derricks and supplies can be found. 
  For your eyes only? The treasures in the craters won't be captured unless you 
  send in paratroops or terrorist ambushs. This is intended though. Only USA will 
  be able to harvest the supplies in the central crater.</p>
<h4>AI</h4>
<p>I have not tested this map a lot since I don't like it. Last time I did it 
  I lost against two computers although I was playing pretty well. Since it is 
  hard to cover all entrances, GLA troops can blast into your base and attack 
  anything that moves. Oil refineries and hospitals are captured by the computer, 
  but the crater oil derricks are out of range, something the computer cannot 
  figure out himself...</p>
