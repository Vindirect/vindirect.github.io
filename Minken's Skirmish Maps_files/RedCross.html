<h4>About</h4>
<p><font color="#800000">Minken:</font> <font color="#0080C0">"Hurry - we 
  need to take out that scud!"</font><br>
  This small map was made in a hurry. Yet another highly symmetrical layout to 
  achive fair play. Somehow it feels like a classic already. You can build a fortress 
  and defend yourself, or rush your enemy. Anything is possible, but you have 
  to decide quickly!<br>
  There is also a slightly different version available: <a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/RedCrossSE.html">Red 
  Cross Special Edition</a></p>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>Desert and mountain ridges. Islands in each corner of the map and one central 
  island. The islands are connected through a desert road network. There are small 
  bunkers on each side of the starting area and two civilian houses on the island 
  in the middle.</p>
<h4>Supplies</h4>
<p>As usual - one supply dock with three supply piles nearby. Each island has 
  an oil derrick, and each base area has an oil derrick within close range. The 
  central island also hosts a Red Cross hospital between the civilian houses.</p>
<h4>AI</h4>
<p>This map is simple enough to offer perfect AI settings. Oil derricks are captured 
  asap by the computer, and the hospital is often destroyed before I get a chance 
  to see it. The backdoor path has been fixed in this release. If the battle goes 
  on the AI sometimes send troops to hold the central island for no particular 
  reason.</p>
