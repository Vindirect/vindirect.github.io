<h4>About</h4>
<p><font color="#800000">Minken:</font> <font color="#0080C0">"This map is 
  huge!"</font><br>
  This map felt like a failure at first, mainly because it looked like one huge 
  lawn. Then I started playing with the height tool on the flat surfaces to apply 
  a more natural terrain, and some other textures on top of that. Finally I added 
  a network of roads to it, and it felt great. This map is big - the size of a 
  normal 6- or 8-player map. Makes a great 2on2 map. There is a <a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/WinterMeadows.html">winter 
  version</a> available also.</p>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>The players will have one opponent near when they start, and the two others 
  on a safe (?) distance. There are a number of ways to advance on this map. First, 
  there are four valleys that meet in the center of the map. Bridges cross each 
  valley to connect the surrounding mountain sides. The upper left and lower right 
  corner of the map holds higher ground with more resources.</p>
<h4>Supplies</h4>
<p>One supply dock and three supply piles close to each starting position. Additional 
  supplies in the center and corners of the map, and in the mountains. The upper 
  left and lower right corner holds oil refineries and a surplus of supplies. 
  There is also an oil refinery in the middle. Four oil derricks are present.</p>
<h4>AI</h4>
<p>There was a big problem with this map causing huge lag. The AI sent troops 
  to capture buildings, but they were unable to find their way to the buildings 
  and ended up humping the mountain sides. I solved this by making an extra entrance/exit 
  from each base area into the mountains, which also turned out to be very good 
  attack routes. Oil derricks will be captured by the computer, as will the oil 
  refinery in the center. The oil refineries in the mountains might not be captured. 
  Computers that fight successfully will move into the mountains to secure and 
  harvest additional supplies.</p>
