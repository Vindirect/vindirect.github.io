<h4>About</h4>
<p>Red Cross Special Edition is basically the same map as <a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/RedCross.html">Red 
  Cross</a>. I have added a few bunkers, and resources have been scattered out 
  towards the center and corners of the map. The center island holds an oil refinery 
  instead of the original oil derrick. Replaced textures for a different feel.<br>
  You can build a fortress and defend yourself, or rush your enemy. Anything is 
  possible, but you have to decide quickly!</p>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>Desert and mountain ridges. Islands in each corner of the map and one central 
  island. The islands are connected through a desert road network. There are small 
  bunkers on each side of your starting position, and on the mountain ridges as 
  well as the central island. Two civilian houses on the island in the middle 
  as well.</p>
<h4>Supplies</h4>
<p>One supply dock in each base area and an oil derrick nearby. The corner islands 
  have oil derricks and some extra supplies. The central island also hosts a Red 
  Cross hospital and an oil refinery.</p>
<h4>AI</h4>
<p>This map is simple enough to offer perfect AI settings. Oil derricks are captured 
  asap by the computer, and the hospital and oil derick are often destroyed before 
  I get a chance to see it. If the battle goes on the AI sometimes send troops 
  to hold the central island for no particular reason.</p>
