<h4>About</h4>
<p><font color="#800000">Minken:</font> <font color="#0080C0">"Why didn't 
  you tell me they can come from that direction?""</font><br>
  My first 8-player map. If you are looking for a big open map, this is it!<br>
  When I textured the center of this map, I was trying to choose between two textures, 
  one black and one red. Winamp started playing Infinite Mass - Area Turns Red, 
  so I picked the red texture, and the name. When you advance from your base area 
  towards the central parts of this map, you will enter this red area with lots 
  of goodies. It will be even more red after splattering your opponents around 
  it. </p>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>As you can see on the minimap, this is once again a symmetric layout. You can 
  choose to start in either desert climate or the bamboo plains. These areas have 
  different textures, trees, sounds, etc. The surrounding areas consist of desert 
  with small camps and four villages. Between the Candy Lakes (!) waits the Red 
  Mountain. It has bunkers and buildings evenly distributed. I've added a lot 
  of stuff to this map - a LOT! It shouldn't slow the game in any way - no area 
  is extremely overcrowded and there are no choking points anywhere. Yes I know 
  the top is a bit dense, but until I have come up with a better idea for this 
  area I'll just leave it. A 450x450 high detail map.</p>
<h4>Supplies</h4>
<p>Every player gets a supply dock, nothing more. You have to advance on this 
  map to win the battle. The four villages have additional supply docks waiting, 
  and the mountain holds some extra supply piles. The small camps in the desert 
  (located inbetween the starting positions) have some supplies and oil derricks. 
  Add three oil derricks on the mountain peak. There is a hospital on the mountain 
  as well as four oil refineries.</p>
<h4>AI</h4>
<p><font color="#800000">Minken:</font><font color="#0080C0"> "If you can 
  beat seven computer-controlled opponents on this map, you are not bad."</font><br>
  Every base area has three wide entrances so you will never be entirely safe. 
  It's fun to watch computers playing eachother as they gather troops at the exact 
  starting point of an attack path and then commence the attack following this 
  path into the enemy base. Most paths in an area will pass through or close to 
  a village in the area. This will make it quite difficult for anyone to control 
  the villages and their resources. The computer will move into the villages pretty 
  fast to secure more funds and capture all the oil derricks and the refineries, 
  as well as the bunkers on the mountain. Why would you want to capture a chemical 
  bunker? Beats me. A killer skirmish map! :)</p>
