<h4><br>
  About</h4>
<p>This map was made in less than 5 hours - I think I'm getting the hang of it. 
  Wanted to make a river, simple as that. Clutha River is a well-known fisherman's 
  paradise near Wanaka on the New Zealand south island. I was thinking of a 6-player 
  map, but this one is only 300x300 in size. The two lower base areas are a bit 
  smaller than the top ones. It's not very symmetrical in terms of resources either. 
  I made the terrain and texture work in a hurry so it's not excellent. A cool 
  2on2 map :)</p>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>The northwest corner of the map is a hill. Here is where the river starts. 
  A river flows from the mountains and into a lake in the southeast corner. There 
  are two bridges and a passage through the mountains over the river. Some small 
  civilian camps and a few houses along the river. A boat patrolling along the 
  river banks.</p>
<h4>Supplies</h4>
<p>One supply dock per base area. Oil derricks and oil refineries close to each 
  starting position. Some smaller supply piles near the river and a supply dock 
  in the northwest corner on the hill.</p>
<h4>AI</h4>
<p>Have not tested much but should work well.</p>
