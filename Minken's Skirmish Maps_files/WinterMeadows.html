<h4>About</h4>
<p>This is just another version of <a href="https://vindirect.github.io/Minken's%20Skirmish%20Maps_files/IrelandMeadows.html">Ireland Meadows</a>. 
  The green textures have been replaced with winter. Some of the trees have been 
  replaced, and sounds have changed.</p>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>The players will have one opponent near when they start, and the two others 
  on a safe (?) distance. There are a number of ways to advance on this map. First, 
  there are four valleys that meet in the center of the map. Bridges cross each 
  valley to connect the surrounding mountain sides. The upper left and lower right 
  corner of the map holds higher ground with more resources.</p>
<h4>Supplies</h4>
<p>One supply dock and three supply piles close to each starting position. Additional 
  supplies in the center and corners of the map, and in the mountains. The upper 
  left and lower right corner holds oil refineries and a surplus of supplies. 
  There is also an oil refinery in the middle. Four oil derricks are present.</p>
<h4>AI</h4>
<p>Each base has four entrances. AI may use any of them. Oil derricks will be 
  captured by the computer, as will the oil refinery in the center. The oil refineries 
  in the mountains might not be captured. Computers that fight successfully will 
  move into the mountains to secure and harvest additional supplies.</p>
