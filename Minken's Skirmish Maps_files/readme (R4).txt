COMMENTS ON THE MAPS

(See individual readme-files for more info)

- ABANDONED TERRITORIES (6)
A medium-detailed 400x400 dirt/desert 6-player map.

- ANTHRAX FORTRESS (4)
Conquer the fortress and crush your enemies!
My first creation. Lots of islands on this one.
Base areas are a bit small - still, it works.

- AREA TURNS RED (8)
My first 8-player map. High detail.
Open terrain and lots of resources.

- ANY ISLAND (6)
My third 6-player map. Nice skirmish map!
AI will kick your @$$!

- BIG MESS (8)
Probably my last Generals map :(
Damn it wasn't! :D
Large desert map with some water.

- CLUTHA RIVER (4)
Small 2on2 map with some nice scenery :)

- DESERT MAZE (MOD) (4)
A modified version of Gravel Maze

- DESERT TRAP (6)
A cool 3on3 or 2on4 map!
One of my very favourites!

- FALL OF METEORS (8)
Big challenge for your tiny defense!

- FATA MORGANA (6)
A low-detailed 6-player desert map.

- GRAVEL MAZE (4)
My second map - Simple, balanced, and fun!
I basically wanted a dark map.

- HIDDEN ISLAND (8)
My first Zero Hour map, based on the map Land & Sea.

- IRELAND MEADOWS (4)
Used to be one of my favourites...
Green hills and resources.

- LAND AND SEA (8)
Playing this large map is great fun! :)

- LIONS FOOT (8)
My second 8-player map.

- KUWAIT CRATERS (4)
Desert settings - deep craters form the center of the map.
Only paratroopers or terrorist ambushs can capture the craters.
Unfortunate lag spikes if computer AI tries to walk there...

- NO SURRENDER (4)
Minken returns in 2009 with this balanced skirmish map! =)

- RED CROSS (4)
This is a small map, suitable for 2on2 as well as 1on1.
This map was made in just a few hours, still I like it a lot.

- RED CROSS SECOND EDITION (MOD) (4)
Based on Red Cross.
Added some bunkers and resources scattered out.

- SIN CITY (8)
My most detailed map - 3000 objects!
A city on a large island.

- SWAMP MATRIX (8)
Looks good... depending on your starting position!?

- TEMPTATION ISLAND (4)
Rush the central island to grab some UN supplies!
A small map with some surprises.

- URBAN DESERT (MOD) (4)
Gravel Maze modified into oblivion.

- URBAN SAVANNA (4)
Same as Urban Desert, just different look.

- WINTER MEADOWS (MOD) (4)
Ireland Meadows in the winter.
