<h4>About</h4>
<p>This is another small nifty map with a moderate amount of resources. The terrain 
  was built using a high feather value. Made in just a few mouse strokes. The 
  minimap looks like crap, but it's not such a bad map after all.</p>
<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>A flat landscape of grass and some willow trees. Water separates the outer 
  perimeters of each base area. A central island. Bridges to connect the continents 
  to eachother. There are a few chemical bunkers in this map. When destroyed these 
  bunkers will spread a cloud of chemicals, harmful for all nearby units. Some 
  buildings are leaking poison, so watch your ground troops carefully.</p>
<h4>Supplies</h4>
<p>One supply dock per base area. Oil derricks towards the center within close 
  range. The central island has an oil refinery, but it can be difficult to capture 
  (as you will notice :). There are some extra supplies in the center as well 
  as some misplaced UN supplies. You can race to the middle to grab the candy, 
  but I would recommend using a fast vehicle that burns slowly.</p>
<h4>AI</h4>
<p>Works well, especially when playing three computers. In most cases the computer 
  will attack from the central island, a dangerous route - but watch all the bridges 
  or base entrances. Oil derricks will be catured, but the central oil refinery 
  stands untouched!</p>
